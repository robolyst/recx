`recx` compares a *candidate* `pandas.DataFrame` against a *baseline* using declarative,
column-level checks (exact equality, absolute tolerance, relative tolerance, or custom
logic). It produces structured results you can assert on in tests or render as a concise
textual summary.

> Status: Early, experimental. API may change.

## Install

With `pip`:

```bash
pip install recx
```

with `uv`:
```bash
uv add recx
```

## Features

* Index presence checks (missing + extra index values) out of the box
* Built-in column checks:
	* `EqualCheck` -- exact equality (treats aligned NaNs as equal)
	* `AbsTolCheck` -- absolute error within tolerance (optional sort of failures)
	* `RelTolCheck` -- relative error within tolerance (optional sort of failures)
* Rich per-check results (`CheckResult`) and aggregate (`RecResult`).
* Easy to extend: implement a single `check` method on a `ColumnCheck` subclass
